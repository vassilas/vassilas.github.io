                I began my professional career at Think-Silicon as a Hardware Design Engineer, where I integrated graphics processing units 
                and display controllers, enhancing my expertise in hardware simulation and testing. My tenure at the National 
                Meteorological Service of Greece not only provided me with a unique opportunity to serve my country but also allowed 
                me to expand my skill set to include meteorological observation and the implementation of telemetry sensor systems.

                I began my career at Mellon Technologies as a Junior Embedded Software Engineer, where I developed software for EFT POS 
                payment applications. For the first one and a half years, I focused on writing payment applications in C programming language 
                for banks primarily in Balkan countries. This role provided me with extensive experience in embedded software 
                development and the intricacies of financial transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                After gaining two years of experience, I joined the Android development team. Here, we continued to advance POS 
                payment applications, this time for Android devices, utilizing Java programming language. 
                This transition allowed me to expand my expertise into mobile payment solutions and modern software 
                development practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my tenure at Mellon Technologies, I had the opportunity to participate in several projects from inception 
                to completion. My responsibilities included project and technical analysis of requirements, daily communication with 
                clients, developing the POS applications, and ensuring they met stringent certification standards from VISA, Mastercard, 
                American Express, and other card schemes. Additionally, I was involved in monitoring the applications in production, 
                ensuring their reliability and efficiency. This comprehensive involvement provided me with a holistic view of the project 
                lifecycle and deepened my understanding of the payment industry's regulatory and technical demands.

                During my military service, I received training and certification as a Meteorological Observer. My primary duty was 
                stationed at the meteorological station at Rhodes Airport, where I was responsible for reporting weather 
                conditions to pilots, ensuring flight safety through accurate and timely weather updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my observational duties, I was a member of a development team tasked with maintaining and developing 
                in-house software for the National Meteorological Service of Greece. This role involved creating and optimizing 
                various software applications critical for the service's operations, allowing me to apply my software engineering 
                skills in a real-world, high-stakes environment.

                I began my professional journey with a three-month internship at Think-Silicon as a Hardware Design Engineer. 
                During this period, my primary responsibilities included integrating hardware simulation testbenches for 
                Think-Silicon’s display controller with ARM CPUs and designing a bridge protocol from Wishbone to AHB 
                using Verilog. This role provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in hardware design and verification, 
                laying a strong foundation for my technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the internship, I continued my career at Think-Silicon for an additional three months. In this 
                extended role, I focused on integrating the graphics processing unit and display controller with the 
                Synopsys ARC CPU, utilizing Xilinx FPGA technology. This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise 
                in FPGA design and CPU integration, further enhancing my capabilities in hardware engineering and system architecture.
